    "1. Regularization:\n",
    "   - **L1 and L2 Regularization:** Introduce penalty terms based on the magnitudes of the model parameters.\n",
    "       This discourages the model from assigning too much importance to individual features, preventing it from becoming overly complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cross-Validation:\n",
    "   - **K-fold Cross-Validation:** Split the dataset into k subsets and train the model k times, each time using k-1 subsets for training \n",
